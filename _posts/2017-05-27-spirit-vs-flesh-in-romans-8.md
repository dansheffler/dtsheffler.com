This weekend I am preaching at all three CF churches on the first half of Romans 8.  We can learn quite a bit about the Holy Spirit by studying this dense portion of Scripture since Paul draws an extended contrast between life in the Spirit and life in the flesh.  You can find the presentation I will use [here](http://dtsheffler.com/presentations/Romans8.html#/).
