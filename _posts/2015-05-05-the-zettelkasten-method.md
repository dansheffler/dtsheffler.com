Summary: An overview of the zettlekasten method for taking notes.

Since classes have let out, I finally have a little more time to
continue posts on my method of taking notes.  Several friends have
asked me about my methods in the last few weeks and I was able to
point them to my posts on paper note taking ([Two Goals][] and
[Notebook Annotation][]), but not the specifics of my computer
system.

In this post I will simply summarize the concept of the
zettelkasten method as I understand it.  In the next post, I will
detail my implementation of the method in Sublime Text.

A few years back I took a Saturday and read every single post in
the archives of the excellent [Taking Note][] blog.  The author of
this blog is partial to the system created by sociologist [Niklas
Luhmann][] which you can read about in detail in [this post][].

Luhmann's system uses index cards (German=*zettel*) in a slip box
(German=*kasten*).  Each new card receives a unique number that
other cards can reference.  The specifics of Luhmann's system don't
matter much in the world of computer notes, but a few architectural
points *do* matter whatever medium you use:

1. The notes are organized topically rather than chronologically or
   by association with a document (as in marginal notes).
2. The size of the cards encourages one idea per note.  Thus cross
   referencing is rather fine grained.  Further, when working with
   the notes for a writing project, one can deal with small,
   manageable chunks rather than, say, *all my notes on Plato*.
3. His numbering system allows for branching.  Thus parent notes
   can have children, allowing for some degree of hierarchical
   organization.
4. A new idea can simply receive a new number in sequence, allowing
   notes to easily break free from a strict, preconceived
   hierarchical organization.
5. The act of linking between notes is explicit through manually
   written cross-reference.  This makes note association
   intentional in contrast to word usage associations in (e.g.)
   DevonThink or the use of tags.

All of these features combine into one big feature that I care most
about: with the zettelkasten method I can actually *use* my notes.
Right now I have 484 files (zettels) in my notes folder.  Some of
these are long, some short, and some more than three years old.
Yet I can actually find all the notes I need, associate one note
with another rapidly, and use these notes in the process of writing
my dissertation.

This happens because the zettelkasten method strikes a balance
between order and freedom.  On the one hand, we can imagine a note
system with *no* organization.  Just write whatever comes into your
head in a single stream.  These notes will rapidly become useless
because the stuff you want is mixed in with all the cruft.  On the
other hand, we can imagine a note system that rigidly orders notes,
tags their contents, forces a certain title style, sorts each note
into one of sixteen categories, requires a template that must be
filled out before a note can be created, and will not let you write
down any thoughts until you have done your push-ups for the day.
This system is useless already simply because it will never be
used.  The zettelkasten method gets it just right.  I can create a
note rapidly yet just as rapidly find that note again when I need
it in usable form for writing.
