Shawn Graham just put up a nice [post][] over at [Electric
Archaeology][], in which he impliments some of my Skim--Markdown
[scripts][].  If you have had any trouble with those scripts I
suggest looking at his post since he explains in more detail a few
things I didn't.

(By the way: [PDFtk][] does run on OSX as a command-line tool
called PDFtk Server; the GUI is Windows only.  I use this in the
apple script just to pull out PDF bookmarks, which I use for
chapters in books, and make these headers in the resulting markdown
---very useful organization for 300 pages of notes.  As Shawn
mentions, the script runs fine without this, however.)
