This is my translation of Horace's Ode I.11, which is the origin of the famous phrase "carpe diem."  I've been working on polishing this on and off for a while now, trying to convey not only the meaning but also the emotional tenor in English.  Original Latin below.

> Don't seek to know what is a sin to know:\
> What end the Gods will give to you, to me, Leuconoe.\
> Nor try the Babylonian numbers either. But suffer whatever will be.\
> Whether Jupiter give many winters or one last,\
> as the Tyrrhenian sea breaks on the rocks.\
> Be wise, prepare the wine, and since time is short,\
> long hopes cut back.  While we talk, envious age flees.\
> Take today, and trust what comes after as little as you can.

> Tū nē quaesierīs, scīre nefās, quem mihi, quem tibī\
> fīnem dī dederint, Leuconoē, nec Babylōniōs\
> temptāris numerōs. Ut melius quidquid erit patī,\
> seu plūrīs hiemēs seu tribuit Iuppiter ultimam,\
> quae nunc oppositīs dēbilitat pūmicibus mare\
> Tyrrhēnum: sapiās, vīna liquēs, et spatiō brevī\
> spem longam resecēs. Dum loquimur, fūgerit invida\
> aetās: carpe diem, quam minimum crēdula posterō.
