This is my translation Horace's Ode IV.7, famous for the opening words "Diffugere nives," and the echo of Abraham's sentiment that we are but "ashes and shadows."<!--more-->

| The snows have gone.  The grass returns
|   to the meadows and buds to the trees.
| Earth alters and the streams
|   trickle down between their banks.
| Grace, with her nymphs and her twin sisters,
|   naked leads the dancing circle.
| Don't dream of deathless things---
|   the year warns and the hour steals the sweet day.
| Cold yields to spring winds, but spring,
|   buried in its turn, will pass into summer.
| Bountiful autumn pours out its fruit
|   but soon the lifeless winter comes round again.
| The quickening moons recover
|   their losses in heaven, while we---
| When we go down where pious Aeneas went,
|   where rich Tullus and Ancus went
|   ---we are but ashes and shadows.
| Who knows whether the gods above will add
|   tomorrow's times to this day's account.
| Everything you've gathered for your own sweet soul
|   will slip through the hands of your heir.
| When you finally die,
|   and Minos has given his fateful judgment,
| It won't be your family name, Torquatus, it won't be your genius,
|   it won't even be your religion that saves you.
| For Diana does not free Hippolytus
|   from the shadows below,
| Nor can Theseus break his precious Pirithous
|   from the chains of Lethe.
