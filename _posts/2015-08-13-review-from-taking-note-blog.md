MK over at the [Taking Note
Blog](http://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/) just commented on [my
recent post](http://www.dtsheffler.com/blog/2015-08-05-one-
thought-per-note/) about one thought per note.  He helpfully adds
several more links on the same idea and mentions that this is "one
of the most basic features" of his note-taking.

I have mentioned the Taking Note Blog before, and I highly
recommend it.  A few years ago I took a saturday and read through
every single post in the archives---and have kept up with every
post since.  This has probably been the single greatest influence
on the way that I think about managing information.  So head over
there and start taking notes!
