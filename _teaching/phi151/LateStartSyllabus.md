## Course Description and Learning Outcomes ##

*From the Catalog*:   Introduction to important texts and authors, including Aristotle, Kant, and Mill, who provide interesting answers to the question, "How should one live?"

*From Me*:  In this course we will learn about right and wrong.  Is it wrong to kill someone?  What if doing so will save ten lives?  Do you really have to donate money to charity? Or is it just something nice to do?  More importantly, *what makes* murder wrong and giving to charity good?  In order to think through these questions for ourselves, we will read the primary sources from the three most influential ethical systems: (i) utilitarianism, (ii) kantianism, and (iii) virtue ethics.  We will attempt to understand the very different ways that these systems have conceived of what makes one thing right and another thing wrong.  I hope that by exploring the ways that influential thinkers have understood morality you will come to a more mature understanding yourself and that this will impact the way you live your life.

--------------------------- ----

The first portion of your grade will come from regular (short) reading quizzes. These will be completed on Moodle and will typically consist of five multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due by midnight on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers if you have not read it, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz. You will quickly find that you really must do the reading and do it quite carefully to do well on these quizzes.

At the end of each unit, you will submit a short (700--1000 words) paper on Moodle analyzing and reflecting upon an ethical dillema through the lens of the system we discuss in that unit.  This paper will consist of one section (at least 350 words) that analyzes the way our author would answer a difficult ethical question and another section (at least 350 words) that presents your own argument on the same topic.  I will not accept papers that fail to meet these length requirements.  Instead, your paper will simply rack up deductions for lateness until you turn in a paper of sufficient length.  See [these instructions](http://www.dtsheffler.com/phi151analysispaper/) for specific steps to getting an A and the specific rubric I use while grading.

**Grading Scale:**

(I round all values to the nearest whole percent.)

--- ------------------
A   100--90% 
B   89--80%  
C   79--70%  
D   69--60%  
E   59--0%

## E-mail and Internet ##

You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly. Section related announcements will be made via e-mail (e.g. pointers for home work, change in due dates). Also, e-mail is the best way for contacting me.

You are expected to have access to a stable internet connection as reading quizzes are carried out through Moodle.  I will not reset quizzes because of internet trouble (doing so is simply too easy to abuse and has been in the past).  Instead, I will be dropping the lowest reading quiz score for everyone.



## Academic Integrity ##

Cheating robs other students of a fair grade. If it is determined that a student has cheated, all students involved will receive a grade of zero for the assignment. If the case is egregious, I will direct the case to the appropriate university dean for official sanction.  Please see the Academic Honesty Policy in your Student Handbook.


## Disability Accommodations ##

If you are registered to receive accommodations for a disability, please discuss them with me during the first week of class.  You will need official documentation from Lloyd Clark in the Wellness Center (x7074).
