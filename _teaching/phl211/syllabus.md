## Course Description and Learning Outcomes ##

This course will survey the history of philosophy from the presocratic Greeks to the late Middle Ages (roughly 600 BC--1500 AD).  In the beginning, we will cover the ancient atomists, Eleatics, and Pythagoreans.  Before midterm, we read several major works by Plato and Aristotle.  After midterm, we will read Augustine, Anselm, and Thomas, finally ending the semester with Ibn Sina, Al-Ghazali, and Maimonides.

We will go through the major themes of each period and thinker synoptically, but at every stage I have chosen to focus on the particular theme of *the cosmos* as a way to bring all these thinkers together and to understand the role and vision of philosophy in the ancient and medieval world.  This means that for every thinker we will be asking the question: how does he conceive the structure of the universe as a whole?  I hope this will open our eyes to the high degree of agreement amongst ancient and medieval thinkers on this score and the high degree of difference between them and us.

The expected learning outcomes for this course are:
- to learn an appreciation for major philosophers'
  contributions to the Western philosophical tradition;
- to understand the primary questions, terminology, and
  theories in ancient and medieval philosophy;
- to learn to carefully read philosophical texts with a
  critical eye;
- to gain the capacity to communicate difficult
  philosophical thoughts in clear, concise prose; and
- to connect ancient and medieval thinking with one's own faith.


## Grading ##

----------------- ----
Reading Quizzes   30% 
Midterm Paper     40% 
Final Paper       40% 
----------------- ----


The first portion of your grade will come from regular (short) reading quizzes. These will be completed on Discovery and will typically consist of a few multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due before class on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers if you have not read it, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz. You will quickly find that you really must do the reading and do it quite carefully to do well on these quizzes.  I do not accept "my internet broke" excuses for resetting these quizzes (mysteriously there is always one student who can't figure out how to use the internet for the whole semester and they are also mysteriously the same student that has the lowest quiz grades).  In compensation, I drop the lowest quiz grade (because I understand that sometimes your internet really does break).

At the middle and end of the semester, you will submit a short (1500--2000 words) paper on Discovery reflecting on any topic we have covered in class. I will provide further guidance on this paper as the due date approaches.

**Grading Scale:**

(I round all values to the nearest whole percent.)

--- ------------------
A   100--90% 
B   89--80%  
C   79--70%  
D   69--60%  
E   59--0%

## Attendance ##

Although attendance does not compose its own segment of the grade, it is mandatory and failure to attend class will adversely impact your grade. Role will be taken at the beginning of every class period. Perfect attendance will result in an extra credit of +2 percentage points. The first 2 unexcused absences will not count against you, but beginning with the 3rd absence, each absence will subtract 2 percentage points from your final grade. This goes to a **limit of 7 unexcused absences** at which point you can no longer pass the class. For your reference:

Number of Absences  Percentage Change to Final Grade 
------------------- ---------------------------------
0                   $+2$
1                   0
2                   0
3                   $-2$
4                   $-4$
5                   $-6$
6                   $-8$
7                   $-50$




I keep track of absences by calling roll at the beginning of each class using a stack of index cards. If you do not respond when I call your name (perhaps because you are not there) you will be marked as absent. This means that if you walk in late it is your responsibility to check in with me each and every time. Lateness, especially if egregious or repeated, may be counted as an absence for the day. You are always welcome to look at your card and I encourage you to do so because it is your responsibility to keep track of how many absences I have recorded. This is especially important for students who are in danger of failing the class because of absences. I probably will not notice when you have six absences so I am unlikely to notify you when you are in danger of failing. Students missing class or an exam due to an excused absence bear the responsibility of informing me about their absence within one week following the period of the absence (except where prior notification is required) and providing appropriate documentation for the absence. Excused absences are not taken into account in the above adjustment to the final grade. It is entirely the student's responsibility to make up missed work. Make up work (including exams) must be submitted within one week of return to class. If you miss an exam due to an unexcused absence, you will receive a grade of zero for that exam. In general, I do not excuse on-line assignments.


## E-mail and Internet ##

You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly. Section related announcements will be made via e-mail (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates). Also, e-mail is the best way for contacting me outside of class.

You are expected to have access to a stable internet connection as reading quizzes are carried out on Discovery.  I will not reset quizzes because of internet trouble (doing so is simply too easy to abuse and has been in the past).  Instead, I will be dropping the lowest two reading quiz scores for everyone.



## Respectful Behavior ##

Mature, respectful behavior is expected in class. The primary concern is that all students are able to enjoy a focused, helpful classroom. This means that I expect you will among other things: arrive to class on time, stay awake, refrain from taking cell phone calls, playing games, or doing work for other classes. I will warn you once during a semester if a particular behavior is disruptive. If this behavior happens again, I may ask you to leave resulting in an absence for the day.

Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged. For this reason, I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class.


## Academic Integrity ##

Cheating robs other students of a fair grade. If it is determined that a student has cheated, all students involved will receive a grade of zero for the assignment. If the case is egregious, I will direct the case to the appropriate university dean for official sanction.
