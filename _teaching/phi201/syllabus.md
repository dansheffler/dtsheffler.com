## Course Description and Learning Outcomes ##

*From the Catalog*:  Survey of the development of Western
philosophical thought within its cultural contexts from ancient
Greece through the Middle Ages. Exploration of foundational
approaches to questions of reality, virtue, knowledge, God, faith,
and reason.

*From Me*:  In this course we will read major philosophers from the
ancient and medieval periods including Plato, Aristotle, Augustine,
Boethius, Anselm, and Aquinas.  For each author, we will try to
come to grips with his worldview, that is, how he conceives the
structure of reality as a whole.  Where does this author think that
the universe comes from?  What does he think is most real?  Does he
believe in God?  How does he conceive of God?  What does he think
it means to be human?  I hope that asking these questions will open
our eyes to the high degree of agreement amongst ancient and
medieval thinkers and the high degree of difference between them
and modern thinkers.  I also hope that as you explore how great men of the past have answered these questions, you will begin to develop answers of your own.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Foundations Outcomes                    Assessment
--------------------------------------- -------------------------------
**READ** (that is, to examine carefully Reading Quizzes, Final Exam

and, to some degree, to attend to
questions of structure and form as
they impact and/or shape meaning.

critical (that is, objective,

adequate support, independent

**ENGAGE**, deeply and meaningfully,    Final Paper
with course material—including texts,
problems, and questions—and with

## Grading ##

----------------- ----
Reading Quizzes   20%
Lecture Quizzes   20% 
Final Paper       40%
Final Exam        20%
----------------- ----

The first portion of your grade will come from regular (short) reading quizzes. These will be completed on Canvas and will typically consist of five multiple-choice questions on the reading for the day. These quizzes are due before class on the day when the corresponding reading assignment is due. There is a time limit on these quizzes and they can only be taken once, so it is advisable that you complete them just as soon as you complete your reading. You will not have enough time to search the reading for the answers if you have not read it, but you may keep the reading assignment open to aid in the completion of the quiz. You will quickly find that you really must do the reading and do it quite carefully to do well on these quizzes.

The next portion of your grade will come from open-note lecture quizzes that I sometimes give at the end of class to test how well you are taking notes in our discussions.

The largest portion of your grade will come from a Thesis-Driven Essay project that is similar to what you did during your Foundations 111 class.  This time, however, we will be focusing on specifically philosophical argumentation and engagement with the tradition of ancient and medieval philosophy.  This Thesis-Driven Essay project will be completed in stages so that you have time to refine your ideas, learn the skills of writing a good argument, and receive feedback from me and your peers.  This process will include, (1) selection of a specific topic and exploration of the material, (2) a draft outline in which you come up with more ideas than you will use, (3) a rough draft that we will work on in class and will receive feedback from both your peers and me, and finally (4) a final draft.  The first three components of the process will form 60% of the grade for the whole assignment and the final draft will constitute the remaining 40%.

At the end of the semester we will have a final exam that will test your factual knowledge of the names, time periods, and terms that we have learned throughout the semester.

**Grading Scale:**

(I round all values to the nearest whole percent.)

--- ------------------
A   100--90% 
B   89--80%  
C   79--70%  
D   69--60%  
E   59--0%

## Attendance ##

Although attendance does not compose its own segment of the grade, it is mandatory and failure to attend class will adversely impact your grade. Roll will be taken at the beginning of every class period. Perfect attendance will result in an extra credit of +2 percentage points. The first 2 unexcused absences will not count against you, but beginning with the 3rd absence, each absence will subtract 2 percentage points from your final grade. This goes to a **limit of 7 unexcused absences** at which point you can no longer pass the class. For your reference:

\newpage

Number of Absences  Percentage Change to Final Grade 
------------------- ---------------------------------
0                   $+2$
1                   0
2                   0
3                   $-2$
4                   $-4$
5                   $-6$
6                   $-8$
7                   $-50$

I keep track of absences by calling roll at the beginning of each class. If you do not respond when I call your name (perhaps because you are not there) you will be marked as absent. This means that if you walk in late it is your responsibility to check in with me each and every time. Lateness, especially if egregious or repeated, may be counted as an absence for the day. You are always welcome to look at your record and I encourage you to do so because it is your responsibility to keep track of how many absences I have recorded. This is especially important for students who are in danger of failing the class because of absences. I probably will not notice when you have six absences, so I am unlikely to notify you when you are in danger of failing.

Whenever a student knows in advance that he or she will miss class (as for a scheduled college-sponsored activity), the student should discuss the absence with me prior to the event, and the student's participation in the event should be confirmed by a communication from the event sponsor.  When a student's participation in college-sponsored activities or other scheduled events will require multiple absences, the student should discuss the potential for those absences with me prior to the end of the first week of classes.

Students missing class or an exam due to an excused absence (e.g. for sickness) bear the responsibility of informing me about their absence within one week following the period of the absence and of providing appropriate documentation for the absence. Excused absences are not taken into account in the above adjustment to the final grade. It is entirely the student's responsibility to make up missed work. Make up work (including exams) must be submitted within one week of return to class. In general, I do not excuse on-line assignments.


## E-mail and Internet ##

You are expected to have an active e-mail account that you check regularly. Section related announcements will be made via e-mail (e.g. if I am sick, pointers for home work, change in due dates). Also, e-mail is the best way for contacting me outside of class.

You are expected to have access to a stable internet connection as reading quizzes are carried out through Canvas.  I will not reset quizzes because of internet trouble (doing so is simply too easy to abuse and has been in the past).  Instead, I will be dropping the lowest reading quiz score for everyone.



## Respectful Behavior ##

Mature, respectful behavior is expected in class. The primary concern is that all students are able to enjoy a focused, helpful classroom. This means that I expect you will among other things: arrive to class on time, stay awake, refrain from taking cell phone calls, playing games, or doing work for other classes. I will warn you once during a semester if a particular behavior is disruptive. If this behavior happens again, I may ask you to leave resulting in an absence for the day.

Class time is primarily focused on discussion of the material for which I expect you to be fully engaged. For this reason, I prohibit the use of electronic devices in class.


## Academic Integrity ##

Cheating robs other students of a fair grade. If it is determined that a student has cheated, all students involved will receive a grade of zero for the assignment. If the case is egregious, I will direct the case to the appropriate university dean for official sanction.  Please see the Academic Honesty Policy in your Student Handbook.


## Disability Accommodations ##

If you are registered to receive accommodations for a disability, please discuss them with me during the first week of class.  You will need official documentation from Lloyd Clark in the Wellness Center (x7074).
