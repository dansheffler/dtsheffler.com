## What is "Lordship"? ##

- Greek word: κύριος.  Means "master" or "guy in charge."  This
  implies authority over some definite sphere, such as the "boss"
  at work, the "head" of a household, or the "governor" of a
  province.
- Tonight I want to explore the authority of Christ, asking just
  what sphere he has authority over and what his authority means
  for us.
- I will break this into two sections, that have to do with our
  basic response to his authority:
    + *Faith* in his absolute authority over all things.
    + *Obedience* to his authority in our lives.
- Two difficulties:
    + The Hebrew word *adonai* means roughly the same thing.
      Before the time of Christ, the Jews began the pious practice
      of verbally saying the word *adonai* every time they
      encountered the four-letter name of God, YHWH (which we call
      the tetragrammaton because of the four letters).  Translators
      of the OT have kept up this practice both in ancient times
      and modern times.  In Greek, every time the ancient
      translators came upon the personal name of God they
      translated it as κύριος and in Latin they used basically the
      same word, *dominus*.  In English, most Bibles will print this
      with all caps so that you can see when the personal name of
      God is being used and when it is actually the word *adonai*.
      This entered New Testament usage, so sometimes when you see
      phrases like "The angel of the Lord" in the New Testament,
      even though it is not in all caps, it is still being used as
      a stand-in for the personal name of God.
    + In Greek culture, they would frequently call someone "Lord"
      as a fairly ordinary sign of respect.  The closest equivalent
      we have in English is calling someone "sir."  So we
      frequently see people in the New Testament calling Jesus
      "Lord" as a term of address when they don't necessarily
      understand the full weight of exactly what they are saying.
- Nevertheless, there are also many passages where the term "Lord"
  is used in a very loaded way and we need to be sensitive to
  these.
- Jesus is not just *a* Lord, but rather *the* Lord.
- If we could really wrap our minds and hearts around this truth we
  would never again doubt his ability to come through for us and we
  would never again disobey one of his loving commands.  In other
  words, we would *trust* him, which the Christians call *faith*,
  and we would *obey* him from a heart of love and confidence.


## Faith in His Authority ##

- As we saw in the last few weeks, the Jews expected a Messiah.
  They were looking for a king to come and rule the kingdom of
  Israel as the anointed one in the line of David.  They expected
  this man to be a mighty ruler and to govern with a just scepter
  over a renewed people of God.
- The man who came surprised many by being *at once too little and
  too great*.
- He was too little because he did not look like noble blood.  He
  was born in a stable, grew up in a backwater country house doing
  manual labor.  And he never led legions into battle atop a great
  white charger.
- At the same time, however, he was too great for them because his
  kingdom was not limited to the nation of Israel and his authority
  was not limited to military and political power.
- Even his disciples were shocked at the extent of his power and
  authority, and we see a striking example of this in the famous
  story about the storm:

> And the same day, when the even was come, he saith unto them, Let
> us pass over unto the other side. And when they had sent away the
> multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there
> were also with him other little ships. And there arose a great
> storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was
> now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a
> pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou
> not that we perish? And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said
> unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was
> a great calm. And he said unto them, Why are ye so fearful? how
> is it that ye have no faith? And they feared exceedingly, and
> said one to another, What manner of man is this, that even the
> wind and the sea obey him?\
> (Mark 4:35–41)

- We too must ask ourselves *what manner of man is this, that even
  the wind and the sea obey him*.  He reveals himself here as
  *King*, *Authority*, *Lord*, not just over the nations of man but
  over the wind and the waves, over the very elements of the world.
- His lack of apparent military and political power turns out to be
  not from inability but from *total disregard* as something
  beneath him.  In fact we later read in St. John's Revelation that
  he *will* come with legions riding on a white charger with a
  sword proceeding from his mouth.  He simply bides his time
  because he knows that he does not need to conquer the Romans.
  (His disciples will do that readily enough in about 300 years.)
- Imagine being one of the disciples on the boat as he merely says
  the word and the physical elements of winds and waves obey his
  calm command.  Imagine looking into his eyes after this moment
  and whispering, half to him and half to your self in total
  amazement, *who ARE you?*.
- We see this cosmic perspective of Lordship and authority again in
  Paul:

> In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the
> forgiveness of sins: Who is the image of the invisible God, the
> firstborn of every creature: For by him were all things created,
> that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible,
> whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or
> powers: all things were created by him, and for him: And he is
> before all things, and by him all things consist. And he is the
> head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn
> from the dead; that in all things he might have the preeminence.
> For it pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell;
> And, having made peace through the blood of his cross, by him to
> reconcile all things unto himself; by him, I say, whether they be
> things in earth, or things in heaven.\
> (Colossians 1:14–20)

- Notice how many times Paul says "all things," and how much he
  emphasizes that he really means *all* things.  Every single
  angelic, demonic, human power is subordinated to his authority.
  Every single particle in the whole universe holds together simply
  at his pleasure, simply because he continues to give his nod
  toward its existence from moment to moment.  If he for one
  instant merely refrained from saying "Yes" to a single electron,
  it would fly apart into non-existence because it is *in him* that
  every electron holds together and it is *for him* that it exists.
- How *can* we acknowledge this truth intellectually and yet
  continue to doubt in our hearts whether this person Jesus can
  really do for us, in our lives, what he promises he can and will
  do.  How can we continue to doubt that he *will* provide for us,
  that he *will* save us, that he *will* purify us from our sins,
  that he *will* set us free from the spiritual bondage of the
  devil?
- Identify one area in your life right now where you have doubted
  the ability of Christ to move.  Is there some stubborn sin that
  you have not been able to overcome?  Is there some woundedness
  from a past relationship that has remained unhealed?  Is there
  some failure that you have been too ashamed to acknowledge?  I am
  here to tell you right now that Christ has authority over that
  area, and I can say this with confidence because I have met him
  and I know that he has authority over *all things*, no
  exceptions.  Resolve right now that you will trust him with this.
  That you will put your confidence in the one who spoke the
  universe into being with a single command, who turns the Earth on
  its access at his pleasure, and who loved you particularly into
  existence.


## Obedience to His Authority ##

- Now, if Jesus has authority over the wind and the waves, the
  stars and the atoms, how much more does he have the authority to
  give us simple moral instructions that we in duty ought to obey?
- We are different than the wind and the waves because they are
  inanimate, impersonal objects, while he has created us as free
  moral persons.
- When he says "Peace, be still" to the waves, they do not pause to
  think about whether they will obey; they simply do.
- He wants more from us, however.  He wants from us the freely
  chosen gift of love.  He wants us to use our minds to
  *understand* the instructions that he gives us, seeing that they are
  good, *love* their goodness, and freely choose to *act* in
  obedience even when these first two are lacking.
- In the end this is a much more desirable thing than the obedience
  of winds and waves, and the obedience of the saints is precious in
  his sight.
- But this means that there is a profound eternal danger in our
  case: there can be a massive gap between His command and our
  action, and this gap is called *sin*.
- Now, we must be careful to observe that obedience to his commands
  is not obedience to a tyrannical master.  Over and over again
  Jesus has proven his goodness and love for us.  All his commands
  for us have only ever been uttered in love.  He has further
  demonstrated that his love for us is absolute even when we
  completely neglect his instructions or outright reject them and
  spit in his face.  In fact, his love for us is so great that he
  was willing to become one of us, talk to us face to face, and
  purchase with his own blood deliverance from the consequences of
  our disobedience.  How then could we ever look into his eyes and
  say, "nah...I'll do my own thing."
- If we do persist in this disregard for his Lordship all the way
  to the end, we will face a dreadful moment that Jesus describes
  in His famous Sermon on the Mount:

> Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
> the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
> which is in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord,
> have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out
> devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? And then will
> I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that
> work iniquity.\
> (Matthew 7:21–23)

- It is easy to pay him lip service and call him "Lord".  Watch
  out, however, whether or not you are simply calling him "sir"
  like a waiter with no real intention of honoring his authority in
  your life.
- The consequences are terrible if you do.  Can you even imagine on
  that day, coming before him, coming before those eyes that have
  loved you so long, and hearing him tell you finally to *go away*?
  What worse fate for a soul could there possibly be?  Imagine
  protesting on that day by pointing to all the cool things you
  have done with your life---even done in his name and under the
  flag of his kingdom---knowing that your protests are utterly vain
  because you never actually made him *Lord* in your life with your
  obedience to his instructions.
- He tells his disciples quite clearly in the Gospel according to
  John:

> If ye love me, keep my commandments.\
> (John 14:15)

- Several years ago, I asked myself if I even knew for sure what
  his commandments were specifically.  Could I quote any of them
  word for word?  Could I say with any certainty whether I were
  doing *any* of them?  So I decided to go line by line through the
  gospels and pick out each place where he straight-up gives a
  specific instruction.  I left out all the parables or pieces of
  wisdom that *imply* certain actions and simply focused on the
  outright commands.  For anyone who is interested I've made the
  commands from just Matthew and Mark available at
  <dtsheffler.com/commands>, but I've copied here a few simple
  ones from just the first chapter of the Sermon on the Mount.  We
  will end with the reading of this list.  As I read these, listen
  carefully, and take these as something more than mere "nice
  thoughts" from a "wise teacher."  Take these as *commands* from
  an authority worthy of total obedience.  Identify just one where
  you fall short and resolve right now in your heart to *do it*,
  and to do it for no other reason that that the Lord has commanded
  you to.

- In the end, these two aspects, *faith* and *obedience* are
  linked.  If it were simply up to our abilities to carry out our
  obedience to these commands we would rightly despair of any
  victory.  If, however, we look to *His* power and authority to be
  our strength in the fight and place our faith in his Lordship
  rather than our own, we can have confidence that he *will*
  "purify us from all unrighteousness" (1 John 1:9).
