## About ##

<img class="float_right" style="margin-top: 1em"src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/ProfileSmilingSmall.jpg" />I am D.T. Sheffler, a Catholic philosopher who specializes in the history of ideas, especially beauty, personhood, and conservatism.  I am particularly interested in the history of the Platonic tradition and the personalism of Dietrich von Hildebrand.  I am an associated scholar with the [Hildebrand Project](http://www.hildebrandproject.org/), and teach philosophy at [Memoria College](https://memoriacollege.org/).  I am passionate about classical education, and I write about topics such as beauty, virtue, truth, education, and sanctity.  If you are looking for a full CV with links to my various publications, you can find mine [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/cv/).

I am married with three children, I love to read, write, and go for walks in Victorian Old Louisville.  I enjoy long conversation with friends over bourbon and cigars.

I created this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so that I could have complete control over the content I post online and so that I could do everything with [markdown](http://whatismarkdown.com/).  You can see the innards of the site by looking at [its Github repository](https://github.com/dansheffler/dtsheffler.com).

You can contact me at dsheffler at memoriacollege dot org.
