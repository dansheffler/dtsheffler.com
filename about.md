## About ##

<img class="float_right" src="http://www.dtsheffler.com/files/ProfileSmall.jpg" />I am D.T. Sheffler, a Catholic philosopher who specializes in the history of ideas, especially the history of the concept of personhood as it emerges from the classical tradition in early Christian Trinitarian theology, develops through the scholastic tradition, and flowers in the Catholic personalism of the twentieth century.  I am particularly interested in the history of the Platonic tradition and the personalism of Dietrich von Hildebrand.  I am an associated scholar with the [Hildebrand Project](http://www.hildebrandproject.org/), and teach philosophy at [Memoria College](https://memoriacollege.org/).  I am passionate about classical education, and I write about topics such as beauty, virtue, truth, education, and sanctity.  If you are looking for a full CV with links to my various publications, you can find mine [here](http://dtsheffler.com/cv/).

I am married with three children, I love to read, write, and play games.  I enjoy long conversation with friends over bourbon and cigars.

I created this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) so that I could have complete control over the content I post online and so that I could do everything with [markdown](http://whatismarkdown.com/).  You can see the innards of the site by looking at [its Github repository](https://github.com/dansheffler/dtsheffler.com).

You can contact me at dsheffler at memoriacollege dot org.
