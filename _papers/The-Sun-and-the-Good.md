# The Sun and the Good #


What place does the Good have in Plato's ontology? One answer to
this question is that the Good is a form just like the other forms
and that Plato's metaphysical account of it does not vary
dramatically from the account he gives of the forms in general.
Traditionally, however, Platonists have given quite another answer.
According to this tradition, the Good occupies a place distinct
from the other forms because it is their ontological ground or
source and therefore lies beyond both being and intelligibility. In
arbitrating between these two views, the analogy of the sun in
*Republic* VI is of central importance. I propose, therefore, to
examine this passage closely and determine just how much evidence
it yields in favor of each view. I begin by giving a brief overview
of the traditional approach, taking Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius
as representative exponents. I then devote the main body of the
essay to a close reading of the passage in question together with
some analysis of the philosophical difficulties it posses.
Ultimately I conclude that the passage does support the traditional
reading, but that this support is not nearly as evident as we may
at first suppose and relies on the importation of a logic never
made explicit in the text.








## Historical Appropriation ##

In Neoplatonic thought, the ultimate source of reality, the Good or
the One, transcends the realm of being and thus lies outside the
scope of things which are because it is the ground or source for
that realm. Plotinus provides a typical expression of this thought:

> In order that Being may be brought about, the source must be no
> Being but Being's generator (V.2.1).
> [@plotinus92]

This yields an ontological picture stratified into three levels:
(i) the realm of becoming (i.e. spatiotemporal reality), (ii) the
realm of being (i.e. the realm of the forms), and (iii) that which
is beyond being (i.e. the Good or the One).

The observation that the Good does not belong to the realm of being
puts it beyond the possibility of predication also, and thus beyond
knowledge. The Good, therefore, also transcends intelligibility
because the proper object of intellect is that which is. This
strongly negative stance comes out clearly in writers like Pseudo-
Dionysius:

> Just as corporal form cannot lay hold of the intangible and
> incorporeal, by the same standard of truth beings are surpassed
> by the infinity beyond being, intelligences by that oneness which
> is beyond intelligence. Indeed the inscrutable One is out of the
> reach of every rational process. Nor can any words come up to the
> inexpressible Good, this One, this Source of all unity, this
> supra-existent Being (588B).
> [@pseudo-dionysius87]

The Good, therefore, is something which can never be properly known
or understood by intellect because it is prior to the very
conditions of intelligibility. This understanding of the Good has
strong affinities with the apophatic traditions of many religions,
and because of this, Platonic texts are often appropriated in this
context to forward the view that the Good (or God, or the One) is
altogether beyond being and knowledge.

<!-- Doubts About *Republic* VI -->
Central to the history of this appropriation, *Republic* VI
contains the famous image of the Good as the sun. Ostensibly, we
find the direct claim at 509b that the Good is "beyond being," yet
from the immediate context it is not altogether clear what this
involves. It *may* mean, as Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius would
have it, that the Good is not something which *is* because it is
altogether beyond the realm of being as its ground and cause. It
may, however, simply mean that the Good surpasses the form of Being
*in worth and value* but this does not preclude it from belonging,
like the other forms, to the realm of things which really are. If
this second, deflationary reading is correct, then the Good should
also appear as a legitimate object of knowledge. Several of
Socrates's claims in this passage support this reading, yet his
claims are often qualified in curious ways. I propose that we look
closely at the passage and determine just what we can and cannot
infer about the Good from this text alone.





## The Sun and Sight ##


At 508a Socrates lays the groundwork for the allegory of the sun by pointing out the way that the faculty of sight involves three elements:

i.   Objects of sight
ii.  Power of sight
iii. Source of sight

Socrates especially calls attention to the addition of this third
element by contrasting the faculty of sight with the other
faculties. In the case of hearing, for instance, there is no
mediating element between a sound and the faculty of hearing.
Provided that the faculty of hearing is present and the object of
hearing is present, the activity of hearing happens spontaneously.
In the case of sight, however, we need both the light which makes
the objects visible and the sun "whose light makes our sight see in
the finest way and the seen things seen" (508a).[^1] The sun
surpasses light because it is the ultimate "divine source" of sight
and being seen. The identification of the sun with the ultimate
cause of sight, however, brings about a curious feature of the
metaphor as it stands: "though the sun is not itself sight, it is
the cause of sight and is *seen by the sight it causes*" (508b).
The sun is now fulfilling not just one, but two of the three roles
involved with sight. It alone satisfies (iii) in an ultimate sense,
but in terms of (ii) the sun is merely one among the infinite
variety of visible objects. The sun may clearly stand out as the
brightest of all visible objects, but it does belong to the sphere
of visible things.

At first, it may appear that this involves the sun in a viscious
form of self causation. After all, how can the sun be both the
cause of all visible things and be itself visible? We do not need,
however, to say that the sun is the cause of its own existence,
merely that it is the cause of itself *qua* visible thing. Suppose,
for instance, that Solon of Athens creates all the laws of Athens
and thereby establishes what it means to be a citizen of Athens. In
doing so, he does not set himself up as a tyrant, however, but
places himself under the laws which he makes. In this sense, Solon
is the cause of himself not *simpliciter* but merely *as a
citizen*. Similarly, the sun is not the source of itself
*simpliciter*, but merely *as a visible object*.

<!-- Three Analogies -->
Socrates goes on to explain at 508c that the sun is that "child of
the Good" an account of which he promises to Glaucon at 506e. The
sun is its child and is in its "likeness" because it stands in an
analogous relationship to three things---and here Socrates makes
explicit a fourth element of sight that was only implicit in his
earlier description, namely the whole visible realm:

1. The sun is to sight as the Good is to intellect
2. The sun is to visible objects as the Good is to intelligible
   objects
3. The sun is to the visible realm as the Good is to the
   intelligible realm.

Socrates places his primary emphasis on this first respect in which
the sun and the Good are similar. Just as the sun is the ultimate
origin of sight, that in virtue of which all sight is possible, so
too the Good is the ultimate origin of all intellect. Further, just
as the sun is not identical with sight itself, neither is the Good
identical with intellect or any act of intellect, contra those who
would claim that the Good is prudence (505b). From what Socrates
says, however, it seems that we are also meant to consider the
second and third ways in which the sun is related to visibility in
the metaphor. In these terms, the sun is just one among many
objects which are visible and is therefore *within* the visible
realm like all other visible objects, while also being the source
of visibility. From this passage so far, it appears that the Good
should be taken as merely one among all those things which are
intelligible and therefore within the realm of being.

This interpretation of the metaphor is supported by the description
of the Good which Socrates gives at 508e:

> Therefore, say that what provides the truth to the things known
> and gives the power to the one who knows, is the idea of the
> Good. And, as the cause of the knowledge and truth, you can
> understand it to be a thing known; but, as fair as these two are
> ---knowledge and truth---if you believe that it is something
> different from them and still fairer than they, your belief will
> be right.

The Good, then, is something known and merely surpasses knowledge
and truth *in fairness* rather than ontologically. Socrates,
however, inserts cautionary phrases throughout the passage as a
whole, and this last description is no exception. What should we
make of the phrase "you can understand it to be"? This seems as
though Socrates wishes to back off somewhat from the straight-
forward assertion that the form of the Good *is* itself known.
Perhaps this description is merely intended as a pedagogical step
for Glaucon. On this reading, he would not be wholly wrong to
"think of" the Good "as being" something intelligible, but
eventually he will need to leave this partial, metaphorical way of
thinking behind as he comes to a more adequate understanding.
Authors like Plotinus and Pseudo-Dionysius frequently maintain that
there are ways of thinking about the Good that are more appropriate
than others because they lead the mind toward the recognition that
the Good is something ultimately beyond its grasp. Then again, this
phrase could be a stronger prescription, and Socrates could be
asserting that this is the most appropriate way to think about the
Good because this is the way the Good really is. In any case,
interpretive caution is called for.






## The Sun and Growth ##


<!-- Quote -->
At 509b Socrates asks Glaucon to "pursue our analogy further" and
adds another dimension to the metaphor:

> I suppose you'll say the sun not only provides what is seen with
> the power of being seen, but also with generation, growth, and
> nourishment although it itself isn't generation.

<!-- Terms of the Metaphor -->
This addition is so brief that it is easy to let it slip by
unnoticed, but it is striking just how complex the metaphor has
become. The sun already stands in relation to three things (sight,
visible things, and the visible realm), and Socrates is now adding
generation, growth, and nourishment. In parallel, the Good is the
source, not only of the intelligibility in things, but also of
their "existence" (τὸ εἶναί) and "being" (τὴν οὐσίαν). While he
does not state it as explicitly as the other parallels, it seems
clear enough that Socrates means to add a forth parallel between
the sun and the Good to the three we have already:

4. The sun is to generation as the Good is to being.

<!-- Causa Sui? -->
In the metaphor, the sun is the cause of generation wherever it
occurs. He is sure to point out that the sun is not identical to
generation just as it is not identical to sight, but we may still
ask whether the sun is one of those things subject to the process
of generation. In the terms of the metaphor, there did not seem to
be any internal difficulty in claiming that the sun is both the
source of sight and also something which is seen. The sun, in this
case, is a *causa sui* in a weak, non-vicious sense because it is
only the cause of itself *qua* visible object. In the case of
generation, however, a stronger self-causation threatens. If the
sun is the ultimate source of the process of generation then it
will be a necessary precondition for every instance of it. The sun
would need to *be* already in order to cause its own process of
coming to be. Although Socrates remains silent on this point, the
logic of the metaphor seems to indicate that the sun lies outside
the realm of coming to be in a way that it did not lie outside the
realm of sight.

<!-- Transfer Over to Being -->
It is at this point that we find the famous claim that the Good is
"beyond being," but we must be sure to read to the end of the
sentence:

> Therefore, say that not only being known is present in the things
> known as a consequence of the Good, but also existence [τὸ εἶναί]
> and being [τὴν οὐσίαν] are in them besides as a result of it,
> although the Good isn't being [οὐκ οὐσίας ὄντος τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ] but
> is still beyond being [ἔτι ἐπέκεινα τῆς οὐσίας], exceeding it in
> dignity and power. (509b)

According to the traditional reading, this passage claims that the generation of visible objects is analogous to the "being and reality" of the objects of intellect, i.e. the Forms, so that the Good is somehow *beyond* this being and reality because it is the source of it. In the metaphor, the sun is neither something that comes to be nor the process of generation, but the source of both. Given this analogy, we may think that the Good is not itself a being because it is the source of being. The Good then is beyond being in the sense that it is outside of its scope, transcending the realm of being altogether as its antecedent ground and source.

<!-- Alternate Reading -->
According to the deflationary reading, when he claims that the Good
is not being, Socrates may be making the much less radical claim
that the Good is merely non-identical with the form of Being
itself. That is to say he is merely calling attention to the way
that they are two distinct forms. This reading is somewhat
supported if we understand the phrase "surpassing it in dignity and
power" to be a qualification of the claim that the Good is "beyond
being" rather than a separate claim in its own right. If this
reading is right, the Good is not beyond being *simpliciter* but
merely beyond it *in dignity and power*.

The observations that the Good is non-identical with being and
greater than being in dignity and power are, on their own,
compatible with the conclusion that the Good is nevertheless one of
those things which are, and therefore is subject to the form of
Being in that sense. On this reading, this passage about the
relationship between the Good and being is highly parallel to the
earlier passage about its relationship to knowledge. Just as the
Good is something distinct from knowledge and "more splendid" than
it, the Good is distinct from being and "surpasses it in dignity
and power." Nevertheless, just as the Good is something known,
there is no reason to suspect that it is not something which is. We
should remember, however, our earlier caution that this may be
merely the "right way to think about" the Good rather than the
plain truth. If we are to overturn this deflationary reading we
must bring into consideration the logic of what it means for
something to be the "source" of being, a logic which is never drawn
out explicitly in the text.





## Conclusion ##

The famous description of the Good as "beyond being" at 509b in the
analogy of the sun does not immediately or obviously imply a strong
ontological transcendence of the Good. It is tempting to cite this
passage in discussions of Neoplatonism as though it were a clear
statement of Plato's position, yet there are several indications in
the surrounding text that the Good is something that *can* be
known, and therefore belongs to the realm of things which are.
Nevertheless, the fact that this account is merely an allegory and
only proposes to tell the tale of the "child of the Good" taken
together with the curious qualifications Socrates attaches to his
claims that the Good can be known give us some interpretive leeway.
Ultimately, the logic of viscous ontological self-causation
justifies the appropriation of this text within Neoplatonism, but
we must be sure to understand that Socrates never brings this logic
into the discussion here. When we add this logic, the passage
appears in a Neoplatonic light, but if we remove it, the claims of
this passage appear much less radical.
